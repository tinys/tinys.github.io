            Arnim Zola is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic
            books by Marvel Comics. He is a master of biochemistry and is an
            enemy of Captain America and the Avengers. He first appeared in
            Captain America #208 (April 1977), created by writer/artist
            Jack Kirby. He was originally a Nazi biochemist during World War II
            and survived into the modern age by transferring his conscious mind
            into the body of a sophisticated robot which protected his mind by
            storing it in its chest and displaying a digital image of Zola's
            face on its chest plate.
